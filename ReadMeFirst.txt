The supplementary files accompanying this article include a set of R files and datasets as detailed below:

1. meta-analysis of proportions.Rproj
This file is an R project file and serves as the starting point for readers. To begin, double-click this file to open it in RStudio. Once opened, you can access the subsequent R files via the "Files" panel located in the lower right corner of the RStudio interface.

2. code_tutorial.R
Contained within this R script are the code featured in the tutorial, specifically illustrating the logit transformation method.

3. code_notransf.Rmd, code_logit.Rmd, code_doublearcsine.Rmd
These R Markdown files include scripts demonstrating how to perform meta-analyses of proportions using three different transformation methods. The code_logit.Rmd file is largely the same as the code_tutorial.R script but includes additional code pieces omitted from the tutorial due to word limit. To execute the code within these R Markdown files, click the green play button located in each code chunk.

4. data.csv, data_notransf.csv
The data.csv file should be used when applying logit and double arcsine transformations. data_notransf.csv is intended for use when data transformation is not applied.
